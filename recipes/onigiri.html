        <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Onigiri is a white rice ball shaped into a triangle. The Onigiri is often filled with vegetables or meat and it is wrapped in nori seaweed. Although it resembles Sushi, the Onigiri doesn't use raw fish. The rice ball is popular in Japan due to its accessibility and affordability. Plus, it's an easy-to-go snack for anyone who is constantly on the run.
