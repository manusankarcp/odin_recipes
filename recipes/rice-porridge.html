        <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        In Japan, rice porridge is the equivalent of chicken noodle soup when youâ€™re sick.  As such, if a person has just fallen sick with a cold or a fever in an anime or manga (SKET Dance included), chances are a friend will rush over and make them a pot of hot rice porridge.
